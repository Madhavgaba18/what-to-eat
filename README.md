# WHAT TO EAT PROJECT

We have a lot of decisions to make in daily life and then comes the most confusing question of what to eat
so to simplfy it just spin the wheel and know what to eat

# Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- spin-wheel-game npm library

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
